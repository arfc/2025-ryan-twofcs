# 2025 Nathan's TwoFCS

This repository houses the combined templates used for Nathan's Two FCS abstract and presentation (hopefully the abstract is accepted). You can find the license for all of this work in the so-named file.

## Building the Work

Each sub-folder has its own Makefile, which you can use as-directed in the appropriate README for that folder. If you want to build one or both from the top-level, you can use the `make.sh` script supplied here.

Simply run:
```
bash make.sh
```
and supply the appropriate command (it will tell you what to put).
