\section{Introduction}

In 2020, a \gls{haleu} workshop report led by Monica Regalbuto \cite{regalbuto_high_assay_2020} highlighted the unique regulatory challenges of establishing a \gls{haleu} fuel cycle in the \gls{usa}. They note that part of enriching \gls{haleu} is first to produce \gls{leup}, defined as between 5\% and 10\% $^{235}U$ enrichment. The report notes that \gls{leup} facilities would fall under a similar category of regulations as our existing \gls{leu} fuel cycle, a significant advantage for the \gls{nrc} and the \gls{usa} government. Since then, the idea has cropped up in several forums that, if a reactor could be redesigned to accommodate \gls{leup}, it could serve as a useful intermediary step to \gls{haleu}.

% To enrich to up to \gls{haleu}, facilities such as TRISO-X LLC and Kairos Power Atlas Fuel Fabrication Facility must build . Thus, \gls{leup} is an attractive intermediary step for servicers wishing to minimize the size of a Category II facility (thereby reducing costs) as it is the same category we have historically licensed for \gls{leu} fuel enrichment.

% This report also notes that \gls{leup} could be used in existing \gls{leu} reactors, which would allow for a more rapid deployment of \gls{haleu} in the \gls{us}. This is an important point, as it would allow for a more rapid transition to \gls{haleu} without the need for new reactor designs or modifications to existing reactors.

% One of the primary advantages for a fuel cycle containing \gls{leup} is that the facility to produce it would fall under the same licensing category as \gls{leu} fuel. The \gls{nrc} defines a \textit{special nuclear material of low strategic significance} as meeting one of three criteria, the most notable of which for our purposes is "(3) 10,000 grams or more of uranium-235 (contained in uranium enriched above natural but less than 10 percent in the Uâ€“235 isotope)," \cite{nrc_catiii}. This facility definition is where the upper limit of the \gls{leup} range arises.

In this work, we use \cyclus to model the \gls{nfc} of a fuel cycle that deploys AP1000s, Xe100s, and MMRs. After 10 years of operation with \gls{leup} fuel, the advanced reactor fleet transitions to deploying \gls{haleu} versions of the \gls{xe} and \gls{mmr}. We will evaluate the impact of this transition on the delayed \gls{swu} and mass of \gls{haleu} required to meet various demand growth scenarios.

\section{\cyclus}

\cyclus \cite{huff_cyclus_intro_2016} is an agent-based \gls{nfc} simulator
that is versatile, open-source, and modular. The software achieves this
versatility through a series of generic archetypes that are primarily
transaction-based. Over the years, the user community and developers have
created a litany of nuclear-specific archetypes for everything from
proliferation assessment to fuel burnup. Many standard fuel cycle facilities
have been implemented in the \cycamore repository \cite{Carlsen_cycamore_2014},
which holds technology-agnostic archetypes for material sources, material
sinks, enrichment services, separations capabilities, storage services, and a
generic reactor.

\section{Scenarios}
We will deploy reactors to meet energy demands drawn from \gls{eia} and \gls{doe} projections cited in Table \ref{tab:demand_scenarios}. The Low growth scenarios correspond to 5, 10, and 15\% increases in energy demand by 2050, and the High growth scenarios correspond to a doubling and a tripling of nuclear energy by 2050.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \caption{Demand Growth Scenarios}
  \label{tab:demand_scenarios}
  \begin{tabular}{c c c}
      \hline
      \textbf{Demand Growth} & \textbf{Year-to-Year Increase} & \textbf{Source}\\
      \hline
      No growth & 0\% & na\\
      Low growth & 0.17\%, 0.5\%, 1\%, & \cite{eia_aeo_2023}\\
      High growth & 3.5\%, 5.6\% & \cite{julie_liftoff_pathways_2024}\\
      \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
In Table \ref{tab:deployment_schemes}, we describe the three schemes we used to deploy reactors to meet the energy demand. Through the greedy scheme, we are not attempting to capture the complexity of the deployment problem but rather to explore the implications of deploying a certain number of reactors. This random deployment is a proxy for the complexity of the real-world deployment problem; however, it does not include the nuance of how individual deployments meet an end user's needs, which will drive the strategic decisions that utilities and ratepayers behind the meter make in their reactor choices. Combining the random and greedy schemes allows us to inject some uncertainty around which reactor will be deployed at any given time while ensuring meeting the demand efficiently.

      \hline
      Greedy Deployment & Deploy the largest
      reactor first at each time step, fill in the remaining capacity with
      the next smallest, and so on. \\
      Random Deployment & Uses a date and hour as seed to sample the
      reactors list randomly. \\
      Initially Random, Greedy Deployment & Randomly deploys reactors until
      a reactor bigger than the remaining capacity is proposed for each time step,
      then fills the remaining capacity with the greedy algorithm. \\

% The user must manually capitalize initial letters of a subsection heading.

% For those who like equations in their papers, \LaTeX\ is a good choice. Here is
% an equation for the Marshak diffusion boundary condition:
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:marshak}
%   4 J^- = \phi + 2 D \vec{n} \vd \grad \phi \,.
% \end{equation}
% If we so choose, we can effortlessly reference the equation later.

% Another paragraph starts with Eq.~\eqref{eq:marshak} and sets $J^-$ to zero, a
% vacuum boundary condition:
% \begin{equation*}
%   0 = \phi + \frac{2}{3} \frac{1}{\sigma} \vec{n} \vd \grad \phi \,.
% \end{equation*}
% The extrapolation distance is $2/3$. A more detailed asymptotic analysis yields
% an extrapolation distance of about $0.71045$.

% Table~\ref{tab:widetable}.
