\section{Introduction}

As we began developing advanced reactor programs and demonstrations, increasingly fueled by \gls{haleu}, the issues of establishing an appropriate fuel cycle have come to the forefront. \gls{leu} has been the standard for light water reactors, but as we look to advanced reactors, we must consider the implications of using \gls{haleu} and how to best implement it. One of the most pressing questions is whether we should enrich to \gls{leup} or \gls{haleu}. This work will explore the implications of each option.

One of the primary advantages for a fuel cycle containing \gls{leup} is that the facility to produce it would fall under the same licensing category as \gls{leu} fuel. The \gls{nrc} defines a \textit{special nuclear material of low strategic significance} as meeting one of three criteria, the most notable of which for our purposes is "(3) 10,000 grams or more of uranium-235 (contained in uranium enriched above natural but less than 10 percent in the Uâ€“235 isotope)," \cite{nrc_catiii}. This facility definition is where the upper limit of the \gls{leup} range arises.

To enrich to up to \gls{haleu}, facilities such as TRISO-X LLC and Kairos Power Atlas Fuel Fabrication Facility must move up a category to \textit{special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance} (Category II). Thus, \gls{leup} is an attractive intermediary step for servicers wishing to minimize the size of a Category II facility (thereby reducing costs) as it is the same category we have historically licensed for \gls{leu} fuel enrichment.

\section{Results and Analysis}
Table \ref{tab:enrichment_levels} shows the various levels of enrichment for uranium that we will use in this work.

\begin{table}[!htbp]

   \caption{Enrichment levels and their ranges.}
   \label{tab:enrichment_levels}
   \begin{tabular}{c c}
      \hline
      \textbf{Enrichment Level} & \textbf{Range [\%  $^{235}$U]} \\
      \hline
      Natural & < 0.711 \\
      \gls{leu} & 0.711-5 \\
      \gls{leup} & 5-10 \\
      \gls{haleu} & 10-20 \\
      % \gls{heu} & $\geq$ 20  \\
      \hline
   \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Subsection Goes Here (Heading B)}
The user must manually capitalize initial letters of a subsection heading.

For those who like equations in their papers, \LaTeX\ is a good choice. Here is
an equation for the Marshak diffusion boundary condition:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:marshak}
  4 J^- = \phi + 2 D \vec{n} \vd \grad \phi \,.
\end{equation}
If we so choose, we can effortlessly reference the equation later.

Another paragraph starts with Eq.~\eqref{eq:marshak} and sets $J^-$ to zero, a
vacuum boundary condition:
\begin{equation*}
  0 = \phi + \frac{2}{3} \frac{1}{\sigma} \vec{n} \vd \grad \phi \,.
\end{equation*}
The extrapolation distance is $2/3$. A more detailed asymptotic analysis yields
an extrapolation distance of about $0.71045$.



% Later on, we can include a table, even one that spans two columns such as
% Table~\ref{tab:widetable}.

\section{Appendix}

Numbering in the appendix is different:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:appendix}
  2 + 2 = 5\,.
\end{equation}
and another equation:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:appendix2}
  a + b = c\,.
