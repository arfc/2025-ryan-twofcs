	abstract = {As a result of the once-through fuel cycle implemented in the US, used nuclear fuel (UNF) steadily increases. One proposed solution is the transition to a closed nuclear fuel cycle, in which reprocessing reduces build up of UNF. Pyroprocessing is an attractive method for this transition for its capabilities separating both light water reactor (LWR) and metallic fuels, and inherent proliferation resistance. However, unlike aqueous reprocessing plants, industrial pyroprocessing plants do not yet exist. Similar to safety-by-design in next-generation reactors, reprocessing facilities could be designed with safeguards in mind via safeguards-by-design. Without operational experience, these safeguards-by-design need to be derived through modeling and simulation.
This thesis develops a medium fidelity generic model, Pyre, capable of simulating a variety of pyroprocessing facility configurations. Pyre also simulates diversion via a diverter class capable of tracking signatures and observables. Rather than only tracking exact material production, we use signatures and observables such as operating temperature, pressure, and current to mimic the capabilities of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections and aid identification of nefarious fuel cycles, or shadow fuel cycles.
These capabilities are verified in a transition scenario of the current US fuel cycle to a sodium fast reactor (SFR) based closed fuel cycle. Key operating parameters are determined through sensitivity analysis of this scenario, monitoring isotopic changes in material unaccounted for. This work concludes that facility parameters which increase interaction between the salt and waste have more impact on material unaccounted for (MUF). This work also expands the state of the art by exploring the use of sub-facility modeling to increase fuel cycle fidelity.},

  abstract = { Fuel depletion is an important aspect of fuel cycle modeling, allowing a user to account for how loaded fuel compositions affect in-core and spent fuel compositions and their related fuel cycle metrics. Therefore, multiple methods have been developed to account for depletion within fuel cycle simulations. This work adds to that list of methods by introducing an open-source coupling between Cyclus and OpenMC to perform fuel depletion during a fuel cycle simulation, called OpenMCyclus. This work explains the methodology of OpenMCyclus and presents a benchmark comparison between the performance of OpenMCyclus and another Cyclus archetype that uses recipes to define spent fuel compositions. The development of this coupling expands the functionalities possible through Cyclus by providing real-time fuel depletion that is reactor agnostic and open source. }

	abstract = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {Several methods have recently been developed to solve multiphysics transients using the Improved Quasi-Static method and its derivatives. In order to address some perceived drawbacks of these methods, we have developed a new method for solving multiphysics transient calculations using the Predictor-Corrector Quasi-Static method. Our method involves computing reactivity feedback parameters during each transport timestep in order to enable reactivity feedback on the small timescale used by the point kinetics phase of the calculation. The advantage of this approach is that the transport solver does not need to store local ﬂux information between time steps, potentially making it more appropriate for use with a Monte Carlo solver. We have demonstrated the accuracy of our method by solving a simple model problem that exhibits difﬁcult multiphysics behavior. Additionally, we have compared our results against another recently published multiphysics coupling scheme, conﬁrming that our approach does not negatively affect the accuracy of the transient solution.},

  abstract = {Conventionally, the stability of xenon oscillations is estimated by solution of the time-dependent neutron diffusion equation, coupled with iodine and xenon equations, by finding out the damping ratios in each case. This is performed for different initial perturbations and core burnup conditions and is a very time- consuming and tedious process. Some earlier studies include linear stability estimation, which is valid for small perturbations, but not much work has been done in nonlinear stability analysis for spatial xenon oscillations in particular. In this paper, an approach for carrying out bifurcation analysis of xenon oscillations in large pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs) is demonstrated using reduced-order models. The reduced-order model for studying spatial xenon oscillations consists of multipoint kinetic equations coupled with xenon and iodine equations along with explicit fuel and coolant temperature feedback. Both subcritical Hopf bifurcation and supercritical Hopf bifurcation in different parameter planes exist, which leads to unstable limit cycles in the linearly stable region (subcritical Hopf bifurcation) and stable limit cycles in the linearly unstable region (supercritical Hopf bifurcation). The stability map provides a total picture of the stability of the out-of-phase oscillations in a PHWR. Depending on the value of the fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity and coolant temperature coefficient of reactivity, one can determine the operating power level above which the out-of-phase xenon oscillations start to grow. This model can be used to analyze nonlinear stability characteristics without spatial power control, which is helpful in identification of stable/unstable regimes in different parameter spaces and is likely to aid in reactor design.},
